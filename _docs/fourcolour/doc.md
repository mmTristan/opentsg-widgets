# Four Colour

Is the four colour algorithm for TPIGS.Where four
colours are the maximum number of colours to
fill a map. This widget allows 4+ colours to be used
in the interest of computational speed for large objects.

- `colors` - a list of TSG colors, it must be an array
of four strings or more. The algorithm will use the fewest amount of colors required.
